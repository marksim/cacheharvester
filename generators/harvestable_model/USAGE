Description:
    Generates a new harvestable model with specified columns and a corresponding harvester daemon that can be
	started and stopped with ./scripts/daemons start; ./script/daemons stop
	
	To write your model to the cache, use <Model>.store(obj) or <Model>.new(options).store.   The daemon running
	will harvest the models and write them to the database asynchronously.

Example:
    ./script/generate harvestable_model ModelName [column:type ...]

    This will create:
        script/daemons
		config/daemons.yml
		lib/model_name.rb
		lib/model_name_ctl
		app/model/model_name.rb
		db/migration/XXX_create_model_names.rb
